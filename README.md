## Overview

### The Challenge

> As you proceed in your journey to becoming a full-stack web developer, it’s likely that you’ll be asked to complete a coding assessment, perhaps as part of an interview process. A typical coding assessment is a combination of multiple-choice questions and interactive coding challenges.

> To help you become familiar with these tests and give you a chance to apply the skills from this module, this week’s Challenge invites you to build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean, polished, and responsive user interface. This week’s coursework will teach you all the skills you need to succeed in this assignment.

**NOTE**
> Coding assessments are an important part of the interview process for developers. In fact, employers often use them to filter out job candidates with a cut-off score. To help you prepare, we’ve developed a set of technical interview questions that you can answer throughout the course. The difficulty level of these questions will increase as you become a more proficient developer. If you take advantage of these opportunities to practice, you should be well-prepared to shine during the technical interview process toward the end of this course!

### User Story

> AS A coding boot camp student
> I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
> SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

### Acceptance Criteria

> GIVEN I am taking a code quiz  
> WHEN I click the start button  
> THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question  
> WHEN I answer a question  
> THEN I am presented with another question  
> WHEN I answer a question incorrectly  
> THEN time is subtracted from the clock  
> WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0  
> THEN the game is over  
> WHEN the game is over  
> THEN I can save my initials and score

### What I Learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
